# can't change items of vertex_data.factor in compute, it seems read-only.
Can use push_back push only once.
Infer the error lies in mutable.
This problem appears when defining vertex_data as truct with constructor.
While defining vertex_data as typedef struct with vector.resize works?
Maybe in GraphLite, there is some thing like:
Vertex_data* v1, v2;
