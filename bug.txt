# can't change items of vertex_data.factor in compute, it seems read-only.
Can use push_back push only once.
Infer the error lies in mutable.
This problem appears when defining vertex_data as struct with constructor.
While defining vertex_data as typedef struct with vector.resize works?
Maybe in GraphLite, there is something like:
Vertex_data* v1, v2;
The template doesn't support variable container.
