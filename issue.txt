# Load Graph

## Create data struct of vertex and edge.
vertex: word_id/doc_id, vector(topic_id, count)

edge: vector(occur_time, topic_id)

## Divide dataset
The dataset formatted by powergraph is a matrix, with no total number of vertex or edge.
Use python count how many vertex and edge in the raw dataset and write them to the first and second row of the file.
Write the matrix to the file with single space as seperate.
daily_kos doc_word_count.tsv, edge:353160 doc:3430 word:6906 vertex:10336
Use hash-partitioner.pl to divide raw dataset(doc_word_count.tsv) into four parts for each worker of graphlite.

## load graph from dataset
Load graph from dataset file.
